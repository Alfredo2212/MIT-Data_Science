MIT Data Science Projects
--
This repository contains practical projects completed as part of the **MIT Applied 
Data Science Program**. Each notebook demonstrates end-to-end data science 
workflowsâ€”from data exploration to predictive modeling and recommendation systems.

**1. FDS_Project**
Topic: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Focus: Understanding consumer behavior patterns in FBS datasets  
Techniques:
- Data wrangling
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visual storytelling using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

**2. Movie_Recommendation_System**
Build a movie recommendation engine using:
- Collaborative Filtering (user-item matrix)
- Content-Based Filtering (movie metadata features)
- Cosine similarity for recommendation ranking
- Matrix Factorization
Libraries used: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `Surprise`, `scipy`

**3. Music_Recommendation_System**
Goal: Recommending personalized tracks based on user preferences  
Highlights:
- Feature engineering on artist/song metadata
- Similarity-based recommendation using audio features
- Model evaluation with Top-N accuracy

Purpose
--
This repository demonstrates the ability to:
- Explore, clean, and interpret real-world data
- Build scalable and interpretable recommendation systems
- Translate academic theory into production-ready code
